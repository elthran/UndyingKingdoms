</ul>
<h2>Balance Changes</h2>

  <li>Lots of adjustments for unit/building costs</li>

<h1>New Updates for Version 0.0.05 (Feb. 5)</h1><br>
<h2>New Race: Goblins</h2><br>
<h2>New Building: Banks</h2><br>
<h2>New County Factor: Health</h2><br>
<h2>New Feature: Monsters</h2>
<ul style="margin:10px;">
  <li>New building, lairs, limits how many monsters you can train</li>
  <li>Each race has their own unique and devastating monster to use in combat</li>
</ul>
<h2>Balance Changes</h2>
<ul style="margin:10px;">
  <li>Attacking now has slightly higher casualties than defending</li>
  <li>Attacks now have a longer duration (+1 day per 20 troops who survive), so you can not spam attacks</li>
  <li>Getting infiltrated multiple times in one day reduces the success rate of each consecutive attempt</li>
  <li>Limit of 3 thieves per infiltration mission</li>
  <li>Game Reset buffer: Each new age pauses the game for 12 hours. You can buy tyhings and change settings, but the
    clock
    won't advance.
    This relieves the pressure of needing to check in as soon as the game launches to have an advantage.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>UI Improvements</h2>
<ul style="margin:10px;">
  <li>More interactive results on construct/attack pages</li>
  <li>New county initialization page</li>

  <li> - Engineer</li>

</ul>
