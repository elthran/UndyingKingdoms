<h1>Basics</h1>

<h2>Counties</h2>
<p>Each county is controlled by a player. The goal of the game is to manage and grow your county, while gaining political influence by communicating with
other counties in your kingdom.</p>

<h2>Kingdoms</h2>
<p>Each kingdom is a group of counties. At the beginning of an age, each kingdom is in civil war as the counties vie for dominance. Once one player
has secured power and crowned monarch, the civil war ends and the kingdom becomes united. At this point in the game the purpose is to become the strongest kingdom.</p>

<h2>Time</h2>
<p>Each real-world hour ends one game day. At the end of each game day many things change such as the weather, your county's population, your taxes are collected, etc.
    While the game is in testing, each real-world week constitutes an 'Age' of the game. At the end of each Age, the game resets (though your achievements remain).</p>
