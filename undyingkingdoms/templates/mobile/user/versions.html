  <h1>New Updates for&nbsp;Version&nbsp;0.0.05 (Feb.&nbsp;5)</h1>
  <div id="body">
    <h2>New Race: Goblins</h2>
    <h2>New Building: Banks</h2>
    <h2>New County Factor: Health</h2>
    <h2>New Feature: Monsters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>New building, lairs, limits how many monsters you can train</li>
      <li>Each race has their own unique and devastating monster to use in combat</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Balance Changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Attacking now has slightly higher casualties than defending</li>
      <li>Attacks now have a longer duration (+1 day per 20 troops who survive), so you can not spam attacks</li>
      <li>Getting infiltrated multiple times in one day reduces the success rate of each consecutive attempt</li>
      <li>Limit of 3 thieves per infiltration mission</li>
      <li>Game Reset buffer: Each new age pauses the game for 12 hours. You can buy tyhings and change settings,
        but
        the clock won't advance.
        This relieves the pressure of needing to check in as soon as the game launches to have an advantage.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>UI Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>More interactive results on construct/attack pages</li>
      <li>New county initialization page</li>
      <li>Website now supports mobile on more pages</li>
      <li>Race/Class bonuses now appear on relevant pages</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Updates for&nbsp;Version&nbsp;0.0.04 (Jan.&nbsp;31)</h1>
    <h2>UI Improvements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Buying buildings and troops now properly updates total cost before you buy</li>
      <li>New login page</li>
      <li>Website now supports mobile on most pages</li>
      <li>News feed can now show old news</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>New Class Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each county leader can choose a class: the leader's class affects what their county excels at</li>
      <li>Starting with four classes:</li>
      <li> - Warlord</li>
      <li> - Rogue</li>
      <li> - Engineer</li>
      <li> - Merchant</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Balance Changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Attacking with a much weaker/strong army no longer decimates your army, but instead has them flee</li>
      <li>Thief durations for missions has been adjusted. Getting caught has a much larger penalty.</li>
      <li>Building costs updated. Thieves guilds are now more costly; houses and food production are cheaper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Thieves are now working as intended and return as intended</li>
      <li>Leaderboard now properly adds score from traveling armies</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Previous Updates from&nbsp;Version&nbsp;0.0.03 (Jan.&nbsp;24)</h1>
    <h2>New Infiltration mechanic</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You now get 1 thief per thieves guild</li>
      <li>You can send thieves on various missions: stealing gold, burning crops, spying</li>
      <li>Thieves not on active missions will protect against enemy thieves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Inbox System</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You will now be able to send messages to other players directly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>New Racial Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each race will have several strengths/weaknesses, as well as different troop types</li>
      <li>The county creation page will give some detail about races</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Balance Changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Land gained from attacking is now proportional to your land. So attacking counties weaker than you gains
        very little land.
      </li>
      <li>Healthiness has become more meaningful.</li>
      <li>Excess production now gives much less gold</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Quality of Life Changes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Added happiness and healthiness breakdowns to the economy page so you can better manage your county</li>
      <li>Attack page now lets you select troops in 10% increments, rather than listing every possible number of
        troops
      </li>
      <li>Chatroom (Townhall) now auto-refreshes every few seconds and is more user-friendly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can no longer attack yourself (not sure why anyone was trying to do that!)</li>
    </ul>
