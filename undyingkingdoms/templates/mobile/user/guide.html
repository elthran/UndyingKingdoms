  <h1>Basics</h1>
  <h2>Counties</h2>
  <p>Each county is controlled by a player. The goal of the game is to manage and grow your county, while gaining political influence by communicating with
    other counties in your kingdom.</p>

  <h2>Kingdoms</h2>
  <p>Each kingdom is a group of counties. At the beginning of an age, each kingdom is in civil war as the counties vie for dominance. Once one player
    has secured power and crowned monarch, the civil war ends and the kingdom becomes united. At this point in the game the purpose is to become the strongest kingdom.
  </p>

  <h2>Time</h2>
  <p>Each real-world hour ends one game day. At the end of each game day many things change such as the weather, your county's population, your taxes are collected, etc.
    While the game is in testing, each real-world week constitutes an 'Age' of the game. At the end of each Age, the game resets (though your achievements remain).
  </p>

  <h2>Battles</h2>
  <p>A battle simply compares the attack of the invading army against the defence of the invaded county.
    The attack and defence values also determine how many health points (and therefore casualties) are removed.
    The attacker loses many more health points but the defender will have citizens die in the battle.
    The duration of a battle is based on the goal of the attack. An army that fails and retreats returns in half the time.
    Battle results are separated into categories:
  <ul style="margin-left:15px;line-height:20px;">
    <li>Closely matched (when the attacking army's power is within 25% of the defender's): Normal results</li>
    <li>Resounding Victory (when the attacking army's power is within 50% of the defender's): 50% of the casualties but only 75% of the rewards</li>
    <li>Retreat (otherwise): 25% of the casualties but only 25% of the rewards, as the defending county has little value and fled</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Wars</h2>
  <p>After your kingdom leader declares a war, it is permanent until one kingdom wins.
    While at war, all military expeditions are 15% more effective (so more land is taken/razed, more resources are stolen, etc.).
    Each successful pillage attack is 15 war points. Each land taken or razed is 1 point. And each thief successfully sent into enemy lands is 1 point.
    First kingdom with enough points wins.
  </p>

  <h2>Magic</h2>
  <p>Until learning about about the arcane arts, counties can't exceed 25 mana crystals.
    Each spell cast will use some mana crystals.
