  Basic Info (This feature is very new and might be tweaked mid-age. During this period, the numbers will be shown
  here for visibility):
  <ul>
    <li>Gold stolen per thief: 15-25 (+25% bonus for each additional thief), Duration: 14 days</li>
    <li>Crops burned per thief: 1, Duration: 24 days</li>
    <li>County happiness lost per thief: 3, Duration: 18 days</li>
    <li>Scout military: 1 thief (50% accuracy). 2 thieves (70% accuracy). 3+ thieves (90% accuracy), Duration: 6
      days
    </li>
    <li>*Note for accuracy: If enemy has 100 knights, 50% accuracy means thieves would report between 50-150
      knights.*
